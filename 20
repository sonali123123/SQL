#Q20.  Consider a database schema that represents an online bookstore with two tables: books and orders. The books table has columns: book_id, title, author, price, and stock_quantity. The orders table has columns: order_id, book_id, quantity, and order_date.
#Write an SQL query to find the top 3 bestselling products in terms of total quantity sold, along with their names and total quantities sold

SELECT
    b.title AS ProductName,
    SUM(o.quantity) AS TotalQuantitySold
FROM
    books b
JOIN
    orders o ON b.book_id = o.book_id
GROUP BY
    b.book_id, b.title
ORDER BY
    TotalQuantitySold DESC
LIMIT 3;
